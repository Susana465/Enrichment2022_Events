# Enrichment2022_Events

This is a repository where we can brainstorm and collaborate to figure out ways to organise different kinds of socials.

Hopefully this way things discussed will stay all together in one place and we can share with future community champions.

### How to collaborate here?
* Open an issue for a new event idea.
* Write comments on the issues so we can discuss logistics all in one place.
* Keep building up the space!
