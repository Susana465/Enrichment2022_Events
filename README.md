# Enrichment2022_Events

This is a repository where we can brainstorm and collaborate to figure out ways to organise different kinds of socials.

Hopefully this way things discussed will stay all together in one place and we can share with future community champions.

### What can you find here?
* GitHub Issues which contain information of events we organised or tried to organise.
* Find these ideas [here](https://github.com/Susana465/Enrichment2022_Events/issues)
